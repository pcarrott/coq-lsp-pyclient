## Usage
```python
import os
from coqlspclient.coq_file import CoqFile
from coqlspclient.proof_state import ProofState
from coqlspclient.coq_structs import TermType

# Open Coq file
with CoqFile(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "examples/example.v")) as coq_file:
    # Print AST
    print(coq_file.ast)
    coq_file.exec(nsteps=2)
    # Get all terms defined until now
    print("Number of terms:", len(coq_file.context.terms))
    # Filter by Tactics
    print("Number of tactics:",
        len(
            list(filter(
                lambda term: term.type == TermType.TACTIC,
                coq_file.context.terms.values(),
            ))
        )
    )

    # Enter proof
    coq_file.exec(nsteps=4)
    print("In proof:", coq_file.in_proof)
    # Get current goals
    print(coq_file.current_goals())

    # Save compiled file
    coq_file.save_vo()
    print("Compiled file exists:", os.path.exists("examples/example.vo"))
    os.remove("examples/example.vo")

    # Run remaining file
    coq_file.run()
    print("Checked:", coq_file.checked)
    # Get all terms defined until now
    print("Number of terms:", len(coq_file.context.terms))

with CoqFile(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "examples/example.v")) as coq_file:
    with ProofState(coq_file) as proof_state:
        # Number of proofs in the file
        print("Number of proofs:", len(proof_state.proofs))
        print("Proof:", proof_state.proofs[0].text)

        # Print steps of proof
        for step in proof_state.proofs[0].steps:
            print(step.text, end="")
        print()

        # Get the context used in the third step
        print(proof_state.proofs[0].steps[2].context)
        # Print the goals in the third step
        print(proof_state.proofs[0].steps[2].goals)

        # Print number of terms in context
        print("Number of terms:", len(proof_state.context.terms))
        # Filter for Notations only
        print("Number of notations:",
            len(
                list(filter(
                    lambda term: term.type == TermType.NOTATION,
                    proof_state.context.terms.values(),
                ))
            )
        )
